package main

func main() {

	//In Go language, the main package is a special package which is used with the programs that are executable and this package contains main() function.
	// 	The main() function is a special type of function and it is the entry point of the executable programs. It does not take any argument nor return anything.
	// 	Go automatically call main() function, so there is no need to call main() function explicitly and every executable program must contain single main package and main() function.
